# MASTERMIND

**Mastermind** or **Master Mind** is a code-breaking game for two players. The modern game with pegs was invented in 1970 by *Mordecai Meirowitz*, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert. It resembles an earlier pencil and paper game called *Bulls and Cows* that may date back a century or more.

## Gameplay and rules
*  *A decoding board*, with a shield at one end covering a row of four large holes, and twelve (or ten, or eight, or six) additional rows containing four large holes next to a set of four small holes;
*  *code pegs* of four different colors, with round heads, which will be placed in the large holes on the board; and
*  *key pegs*, some colored black, some white, which are flat-headed and smaller than the code pegs; they will be placed in the small holes on the board.

The two players decide in advance how many games they will play, which must be an even number. One player becomes the codemaker, the other the codebreaker. The codemaker chooses a pattern of four code pegs. Duplicates and blanks are allowed depending on player choice, so the player could even choose four code pegs of the same color or four blanks. In the instance that blanks are not elected to be a part of the game, the codebreaker may not use blanks in order to establish the final code. The chosen pattern is placed in the four holes covered by the shield, visible to the codemaker but not to the codebreaker.
