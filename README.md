# MASTERMIND

**Mastermind** or **Master Mind** is a code-breaking game for two players. The modern game with pegs was invented in 1970 by *Mordecai Meirowitz*, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert. It resembles an earlier pencil and paper game called *Bulls and Cows* that may date back a century or more.

## Gameplay and rules
*  *A decoding board*, with a shield at one end covering a row of four large holes, and twelve (or ten, or eight, or six) additional rows containing four large holes next to a set of four small holes;
